# 🔐 Data De-Identification and Masking Website

## 📌 Project Overview

The Data De-Identification and Masking Website is a privacy-focused application designed to identify and protect sensitive Personal Identifiable Information (PII) in digital documents. The system automatically detects Indian-specific PII such as Aadhaar numbers, PAN cards, credit card numbers, and email addresses, and applies de-identification techniques to ensure data privacy and regulatory compliance.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Organizations often handle large volumes of sensitive data that must be protected to comply with privacy regulations. Manual identification and masking of PII is time-consuming and error-prone. This project addresses the need for an automated solution to accurately detect and de-identify sensitive information in files.

## 💡 Solution Approach

* Developed a web-based application to scan uploaded files
* Used customized regular expressions (regex) to identify Indian PII
* Validated detection accuracy by identifying true and false positives
* Applied anonymization and pseudo-anonymization techniques to mask data
* Provided preview of masked content before downloading
* Generated output files and downloadable reports
* Displayed insights and statistics through a dashboard

## ✨ Key Features

* Detection of Indian PII (Aadhaar, PAN, Credit Card, Email)
* File upload and processing
* Secure masking of sensitive data
* Preview masked data before export
* Search and selectively mask specific PII fields
* Download masked files and reports
* Dashboard with data statistics and insights

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Backend:** Python / Java / Node.js *(update as per your project)*
* **Regex Engine:** Custom pattern matching
* **File Handling:** Text, CSV, PDF
* **Visualization:** Charts and dashboard components

## 🧩 Architecture

1. User uploads a file
2. System scans content using regex patterns
3. PII is detected and validated
4. De-identification techniques are applied
5. Masked preview is generated
6. User downloads masked file and report

## 🌟 Novelty of the Project

* **Multi-Format Support:** Works with text, CSV, and PDF files
* **Customizable Masking Rules:** Flexible anonymization strategies for different PII types
* **India-Specific PII Coverage:** Focused on Aadhaar, PAN, Credit Cards, and Emails
* **Regulatory Alignment:** Designed to support India’s DPDP Act and data privacy requirements

## 🚀 Advantages

* Improves data privacy and security
* Reduces risk of data leakage
* Automates a traditionally manual process
* Useful for enterprises handling sensitive customer data

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Support for more file formats
* Machine learning-based PII detection
* Role-based access control
* Cloud deployment and scalability
